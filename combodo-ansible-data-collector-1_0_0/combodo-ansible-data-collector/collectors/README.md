# iTop Data Collector for Ansible

## About

iTop data collectors are simple PHP command line applications to collect data from an external application and load/synchronize the
 information into [iTop](https://github.com/Combodo/iTop) using the data synchronization mechanism built into iTop.

This module is the extra part to collect data from Ansible and... TODO . It needs  the 
[collector base module](https://github.com/Combodo/itop-data-collector-base) to work.
