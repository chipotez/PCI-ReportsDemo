# Extension Ansible playbooks for iTop

## About

This extension provides a set of Ansible playbooks that enable communication between Ansible and iTop applications. 
Together with the [Data model for Ansible](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/products/combodo-ansible-datamodel) extension, 
it allows Ansible playbooks, tasks or modules to directly fetch in iTop CMDB related information like inventory files or 
list of hosts to work on. It allows as well the creation and the modification of CIs in iTop.

For more information about this module have a look at the
corresponding [extension documentation](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/products/combodo-ansible-playbooks).

## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get a
running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss
additional modules.
